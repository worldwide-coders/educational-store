# Educational-Store: A Description

I came up with the idea for this project from my family background.  Community is a major part of life in the countries my family comes from.  A lot of times people will go over to neighbors and ask for some form of food or spice, as none were available at the market.  They give knowing that one day the other will return the favor.

From this I made a community video game share.  Grander idea would be a site where a community could share any resource they have if they want with their neighbors. Starting with video games or movies you can easily borrow from a neighbor rather than pay a rental fee to a large company.

With this application you can search video game postings in your neighborhood.  Find one that available to borrow and request to borrow it.
